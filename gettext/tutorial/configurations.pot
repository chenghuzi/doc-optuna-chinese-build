msgid "The difficulty of optimization increases roughly exponentially with regard to the number of parameters. That is, the number of necessary trials increases exponentially when you increase the number of parameters, so it is recommended to not add unimportant parameters."

msgid "The method :func:`~optuna.study.Study.optimize` (and ``optuna study optimize`` CLI command as well) has several useful options such as ``timeout``. For details, please refer to the API reference for :func:`~optuna.study.Study.optimize`."

#: ../../source/tutorial/configurations.rst:79
msgid "**FYI**: If you give neither ``n_trials`` nor ``timeout`` options, the optimization continues until it receives a termination signal such as Ctrl+C or SIGTERM. This is useful for use cases such as when it is hard to estimate the computational costs required to optimize your objective function."
