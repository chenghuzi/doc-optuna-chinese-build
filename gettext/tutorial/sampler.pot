msgid "A sampler has the responsibility to determine the parameter values to be evaluated in a trial. When a `suggest` API (e.g., :func:`~optuna.trial.Trial.suggest_uniform`) is called inside an objective function, the corresponding distribution object (e.g., :class:`~optuna.distributions.UniformDistribution`) is created internally. A sampler samples a parameter value from the distribution. The sampled value is returned to the caller of the `suggest` API and evaluated in the objective function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorial/sampler.rst:21
msgid "To create a new sampler, you need to define a class that inherits :class:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler`. The base class has three abstract methods; :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.infer_relative_search_space`, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_relative`, and :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_independent`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorial/sampler.rst:27
msgid "As the method names imply, Optuna supports two types of sampling: one is **relative sampling** that can consider the correlation of the parameters in a trial, and the other is **independent sampling** that samples each parameter independently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tutorial/sampler.rst:29
msgid "At the beginning of a trial, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.infer_relative_search_space` is called to provide the relative search space for the trial. Then, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_relative` is invoked to sample relative parameters from the search space. During the execution of the objective function, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_independent` is used to sample parameters that don't belong to the relative search space."

msgid "In this optimization, the values of ``x`` and ``y`` parameters are sampled by using ``SimulatedAnnealingSampler.sample_relative`` method."

msgid "Strictly speaking, in the first trial, ``SimulatedAnnealingSampler.sample_independent`` method is used to sample parameter values. Because :func:`~optuna.samplers.intersection_search_space` used in ``SimulatedAnnealingSampler.infer_relative_search_space`` cannot infer the search space if there are no complete trials."
